# Project Name: Building with Responsive Design

This project consists of replicating the The Next Web website (https://thenextweb.com/) putting emphasis on how it behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is rendered.

* Aligned all elements with float and flex or grid.
* Used a mobile first approach.
* The page layout does not brake on smaller screens.
